    "Currently in the data centric space there is growth in specialized workloads. Each kind of data centric hardware typically needs to be programmed using different languages and libraries as there is no common programming language or APIs, this requires maintaining separate code bases. Developers have to learn a whole set of different tools as there is inconsistent tool support across platforms. Developing software for each hardware platform requires a separate investment, with little ability to reuse that work to target a different architecture. You will also have to consider the requirement of the diverse set of data-centric hardware.\n",

Queues can execute with an in-order or out-of-order policy controllable by the program. In-order execution is an Intel extension.\n",

    "The device execution model specifies how computation is accomplished on the accelerator. Compute ranging from small one-dimensional data to large multidimensional data sets are allocated across a hierarchy of ND-ranges, work-groups, sub-groups (Intel extension), and work-items, which are all specified when the work is submitted to the command queue.\n",

Once the memory is allocated on the host, a buffer object is created, which enables the host allocated memory to be communicated to the device.
